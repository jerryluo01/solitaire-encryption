# Solitaire Encryption (Pontifex Cipher)

An implementation of the **Solitaire (Pontifex) Cipher** in Java, using a deck of cards to generate a pseudo-random keystream for encryption and decryption.  
This project demonstrates both the **cipher algorithm** and supporting data structures, such as a **doubly linked list** to model the deck and the **Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle** for randomized deck initialization.

## ðŸ”‘ About the Cipher
The Solitaire (Pontifex) cipher was designed by **Bruce Schneier** and popularized in Neal Stephensonâ€™s novel *Cryptonomicon*.  
It is notable for being a **paper-and-pencil cipher** that can be executed using a standard deck of playing cards, yet still provides strong cryptographic properties.

## âœ¨ Features
- **Encryption & Decryption**: Implements the full Solitaire algorithm to convert plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa.
- **Deck Representation**: Uses a doubly linked list for efficient card movement operations (cutting, moving jokers, etc.).
- **Fisherâ€“Yates Shuffle**: Initializes a randomized deck for keystream generation.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Separation of concerns between `Deck.java` (deck management) and `SolitaireCipher.java` (cipher operations).
